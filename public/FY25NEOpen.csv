He is working to create a cloud base system that takes sensor and earthquake data, then runs machine learning objects to detect earthquake predications. So the machine learning models output info that can be converted in a forum that can predict earthquakes. The eventual goal for Caltech is to predict an earthquake with higher accuracy and publicize the news via an App, which would hopefully alert the public of the earthquake 10-15 seconds in advance of onset. To do so, Ryan wants to explore using Kubernetes on OCI to manage his data. ",,,"We sent him over a trial and set up a tenancy so that he can explore inputting his data into OKE. From there, we plan to meet in two weeks to regroup and see how his trial went/is going. In the meantime, Shay also has access to the tenancy and will be able to help guide Ryan based on any questions he may have. ",,,0,,0,
